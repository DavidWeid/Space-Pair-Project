# Rover Reddit

Rover Reddit is live [here](https://rover-reddit.herokuapp.com/)!

## Overview
Rover Reddit is an application that hopes to create a positive and interactive community that is passionate about Mars, Rovers, and Space! Rover Reddit is a React-express application built in Node.js that utilizes MongoDB and Passport to create a dynamic and customizable user experience. This application is one of the few places that allows the User to browse Mar's Rover images directly from NASA - a massive catalog available to the public, but largely untapped due to the lack of a friendly UI. Rover Reddit aims to be the bridge between Mars and the User.
